package zork;/** * Class Game - the main class of the "Zork" game. * <p> * Author:  Michael Kolling * Version: 1.1 * Date:    March 2000 * <p> * This class is the main class of the "Zork" application. Zork is a very * simple, text based adventure game.  Users can walk around some scenery. * That's all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting! * <p> * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play" * routine. * <p> * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all * rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates the * commands that the parser returns. */public class Game {    public static Room currentRoom;    private final Room outside;    private final Room lab;    private final Room tavern;    private final Room gblock;    private final Room office;    public static boolean hasFinished = false;    /**     * Create the game and initialise its internal map.     */    public Game() {        // Create all the rooms and link their exits together.        outside = new Room("outside G block on Peninsula campus");        lab = new Room("a lecture theatre in A block");        tavern = new Room("the Seahorse Tavern (the campus pub)");        gblock = new Room("the G building");        office = new Room("the computing admin office");        // initialise room exits        outside.setExits(null, lab, gblock, tavern);        lab.setExits(null, null, null, outside);        tavern.setExits(null, outside, null, null);        gblock.setExits(outside, office, null, null);        office.setExits(null, null, null, gblock);        currentRoom = outside; // start game outside    }    /**     * Main play routine.
